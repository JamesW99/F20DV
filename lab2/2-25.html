Exercise 2-25:<br><br>

<body>
    <h1><a style="color:gray">Result is rgb(128, 64, 0) </h1><br><br>
    because cc method can find the averange between two color and print as rgb.<br><br>
    such as rgb of red is(255,0,0) and rgb of green is (0,128,0). cc(0.5) means completely average, so the result is rgb(128, 64, 0)
</body>

<script>
let cc = d3.interpolate('red', 'green')
console.log( cc(0.5) );
